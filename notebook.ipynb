The team has a dedicated fan base and plays their home games at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. One of the standout players on the Angels in recent years has been Shohei Ohtani, a two-way player who excels both as a pitcher and a hitter. Ohtani signed with the Angels in 2017 with a limited bonus due to international signing rules. \\n\\nInitially, Ohtani faced challenges during his debut MLB spring training in 2018, with many American news sources expressing disappointment in his performance and questioning his abilities as a two-way player. However, Ohtani proved his critics wrong during the 2018 MLB regular season, showcasing his exceptional talent both as a pitcher and a hitter. He went on to win the American League Rookie of the Year award, solidifying his status as one of the top players in Major League Baseball. His impressive performance on the field has earned him multiple accolades and recognition from both fans and the media.'"
