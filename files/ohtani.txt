From a young age, he demonstrated remarkable potential as both a pitcher and a batter.

His performance in Japan gained international attention, with MLB teams closely following his development.

2. MLB Debut and Unique Role with the Los Angeles Angels
Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, after a highly anticipated bidding process among MLB teams.

As a pitcher, Ohtani is known for his powerful and dynamic fastball, which consistently reaches speeds over 100 mph, coupled with an array of other pitches, including a slider, splitter, and curveball.
